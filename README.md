**You say you’re ‘depressed’ – all I see is resilience.
 You are allowed to feel messed up and inside out.
  It doesn’t mean you’re defective – it just means you’re human.
That's where 'Breathe' comes , a place to talk to , a place to share
your emotions . There's a saying "Half of your problems get wiped 
when you have someone to talk to" , Breathe provides the perfect environmet to 
cope up with 'depression' , 'anxiety'.**
