# 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐁𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐞

**In a condensed, suffocating society you can feel closed off, when you can't process your emotions and are going through inner turmoil which you can't speak about. That's where 'Breathe' comes, a place to communicate, a place to share your pain. There's a saying "Half of your problems get wiped off when you have someone to talk to"; Breathe provides the perfect environmet to cope up in a mentally claustrophic world.**
